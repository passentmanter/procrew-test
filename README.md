# ProCrew React TypeScript Project

## Overview

This is a React application built using TypeScript. It aims to showcase a modular and reusable component architecture, leveraging React's functional components and TypeScript's strong typing. The project is set up with **Create React App** and uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd procrew-test
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will run on http://localhost:3000.

## Project Structure

- **src/components**: Contains reusable components .
- **src/pages**: Organizes page-level components for main sections .
- **public**: Contains static files.

## Technical Approach and Architectural Decisions

This project leverages **React** with **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and maintainable code.
**Tailwind CSS** is integrated for styling, allowing a utility-first approach that makes it easy to create responsive and customizable UIs.


1. ### Key Technologies

- **React**: For building the UI components.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety to JavaScript, preventing potential errors and improving code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework is used to speed up development and reduce custom CSS, focusing on consistency and maintainability across the application.

2. ### User Interface & Styling

- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be responsive, using Flexbox to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes.
